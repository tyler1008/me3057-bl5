function [ indices ] = segmentData( x, y )
%segmentData() plots data x and y and allows the user to select on the
%   figure where they would like to divide the data into segments. Returns 
%   the indices for the start and end of each data segment. Assumes that x
%   is sorted, either ascending or descending.
